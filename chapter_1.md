# 基础理论及技术介绍

本章只概述现有的基础理论及技术，
所涉及的理论及技术的详情将在后续章节中陆续展开。

In this chapter, we will deliver an overview of exciting and relevant 
technical areas essential to professionals in the data acquisition system and 
the IoT industry. This introductory chapter provides a taste of what to expect 
from this course. After a short introduction to data acquisition and IoT you 
will be guided through 5 modules:
* Cool Applications
* Sensors
* Embedded Systems
* Networking and cloud IoT
* Circuits (very brief survey, **hardware background is NOT needed**)

This chapter is designed to give an overview of data acquisition and the 
Internet of Things. If you decide to pursue to enroll in this course, this short 
chapter should be taken before you start the entire course.

This chapter closely maps to subject focus areas within the whole course, 
and is intended to assist the student in understanding the focus technology. 

## Prerequisites
This course is designed for anyone whos background is software oriented but 
is interested in data acquisition and IoT, for those who are preparing to 
build a solid knowledge structure in the new era of AI. There are no prerequisites 
for this short course.
