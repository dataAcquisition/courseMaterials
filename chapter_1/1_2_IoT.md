## Definition

The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects ¡ª ¡°things¡± ¡ª 
that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose 
of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. 
These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial 
tools. Experts are expecting IoT devices number to grow to 22 billion by 2025, 
and to reach more than a trillion devices by 2035. 


## Description

The Internet of Things is transforming our physical world into a complex and 
dynamic system of connected devices on an unprecedented scale.

Advances in technology are making possible a more widespread adoption of IoT, 
from pill-shaped micro-cameras that can pinpoint thousands of images within the 
body, to smart sensors that can assess crop conditions on a farm, to the smart 
home devices that are becoming increasingly popular. But what are the building 
blocks of IoT? And what are the underlying technologies that drive the IoT 
revolution?

## Top IoT Companies to Watch Out in 2021 

![top IoT companies in 2021](pix/IOT-Conpanies.png)

IoT has made complete automation possible. The solutions like Smart cities, 
Smart Home, Smart Factory, and Connected Vehicle are possible only because of IoT.

IoT has differently shaped traditional industries. It is based on ICT (Information 
and Communication Technology). It has combined both the physical and digital 
worlds together.

This technology will indeed help in streamlining business processes and thereby 
boost productivity to a great extent. It will give the manufacturing industry 
the ability to provide better products and services.

IoT can be understood by taking a simple Example of Smart Home. IoT made it 
possible to make the homes Smart homes where even the lights can be switched on 
or off using the smartphones. 

The devices which we have never imagined with the internet, are now connected 
to the internet and that is IoT. It has given the power to objects to 
communicate without any human intervention.

The image given below will show you the spending of IoT worldwide and thereby 
depict the growth of IoT.

## IoT Devices

IoT devices support the expansion of internet connection beyond the usual 
standard devices like computers, laptops, smartphones etc.

The IoT devices are purely integrated with high definition technology which 
makes it possible for them to communicate or interact over the internet smoothly 
and can also be managed and controlled remotely when required.

![IoT Devices](pix/Internet-of-ThingsIoT-Devices.png)

It is a matter of fact today that a number of IoT products have surpassed a 
huge number of humans on this planet.

Approximately there are around 7.62 billion humans on our planet, but to your 
surprise, by the year 2021 with an increasing graph of IoT devices, there may 
be around 20 billion IoT smart devices up and running with an increase in the 
demand of 5g network.

Please refer the below graph for to know the increasing demand for these devices 
in the near future:

![IoT devices demands](pix/2018-12-19_11-01-20.png)

If an average is made then after some years each and every individual in 
America would be having more than 10 IoT devices of their own. Please refer 
this [post](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/302663/north-american-consumers-to-have-13-connected-devi.html) 
to more about this statistical data.

Nowadays, the production and usage of the Internet of Things devices are 
increasing very rapidly. IoT products and devices basically include laptops, 
smartphones, smart gadgets, smart watches, smart and digitalized vehicles and 
almost all of these are used majorly today.

How does IoT work and what does makes them smart device?

It basically depends on two things to transform a normal device into IoT smart 
device.

**They are:**

1. The device which has the capability to connect with the internet in any way.
2. The device which is integrated with technology like sensors, functional 
software, some inbuilt technology which support network connections and also 
actuators.

When both these functionalities are combined together an IoT device is formed. 
Earlier only simple watches were only used to see the time and date, but now 
the smart IoT watches allow a user to see heartbeat rate, calorie count, steps 
walked etc.

The market for IoT devices is expanding rapidly day by day and becoming more 
popular as well with the drastic increase in the number of users who use them 
daily.

IoT Life Cycle
IoT has a very simple lifecycle of development.

Deployment followed by monitoring, servicing, managing, which is followed by regular updates and decommissioning at the end.

IoT Product Lifecycle is described in the below diagram.
