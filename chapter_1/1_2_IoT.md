## Description

The Internet of Things is transforming our physical world into a complex and 
dynamic system of connected devices on an unprecedented scale.

Advances in technology are making possible a more widespread adoption of IoT, 
from pill-shaped micro-cameras that can pinpoint thousands of images within the 
body, to smart sensors that can assess crop conditions on a farm, to the smart 
home devices that are becoming increasingly popular. But what are the building 
blocks of IoT? And what are the underlying technologies that drive the IoT 
revolution?
